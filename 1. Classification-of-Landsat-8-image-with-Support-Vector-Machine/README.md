# Landsat 8 image classification with Support Vector Machine

The project is designed to classify the landcover of a Landsat 8 image using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with Python 3. The satellite image is taken over Toledo, Ohio, United States area which mainly consists of vegetation, water, and buildings. SVM algorithm is imported from the Python library 'Scikit-learn', which is efficient in data analysis and data mining.   

## Prerequisite

The following libraries should be installed on python 3 to run the python script.
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Geopandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Rasterio
6. Earthpy
7. Shapely
8. Scikit-learn
